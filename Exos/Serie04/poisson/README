This code is composed of multiple files:

- poisson.cc
  contains the main function and the size of the problem

- simulation.cc
  contains the poisson solver
  "compute_step" does the update of the grid for one step
  "compute" does the loop with step computation and the swaping of the grids

- grid.cc
  contains a simple 2d grid stored in a 1d array

- dumpers.cc
  contains 2 implementations of a dumper, one generates ascii files
  (pgm) the other one writes binary files (bmp)

- double_buffer.cc
  contains a simple tool to swap two grids
